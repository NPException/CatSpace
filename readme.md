## Basics
So you start on your home planet, with little units moving along it's surface.

You must gather resources (just one type for now) and create buildings. Your first goal is to build a space center. Once you have done that, you can launch a number of units to other planets to gather more resources or build colonies.

## Further Ideas
- [ ] **Different resource types** and their harvest-buildings
 - [ ] wood
 - [ ] ore
 - [ ] oil / fuel (make rockets use fuel)
 - [ ] food / livestock

- [ ] **Build rockets manually** (like KSP simplified)
 - [ ] research parts first

REMEMBER:
  Must not end streak!
